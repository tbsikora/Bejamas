# Cypress Test Suite for Navigation and Contact Form

This project contains end-to-end tests implemented using **Cypress JS**. The test suite verifies the functionality of the main navigation links and the contact form. A basic data-driven approach is used for scalability and maintainability.

## **Features Implemented**

### **Main Navigation Tests**
- Validates that clicking on each navigation link leads to the correct page.
- Verifies the `<h1>` headers on the pages for expected content.
- Handles dynamic modal interactions (e.g., navigating to the "Blog" page through the "Learn" modal).

### **Contact Form Tests**
- Verifies the presence of placeholders and labels for input fields.
- Dynamically generates test data (email and message) using a simple generator.
- Validates form submission and ensures fields are cleared afterward.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Cypress JS**: End-to-end testing framework.
- **JavaScript**: Test scripting and data management.

---

## **Data-Driven Approach**

A basic data-driven approach is used by storing selectors, expected headers, and other reusable test data in separate files. This makes the test suite modular and easy to maintain.
